# Overview of the School District Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to review data and identify trends and correlations that are taking place between test scores and school spending, size, and type. We want to identify develop recommendations to the school district that will help to increase student passing percentages across all schools.

As we can see from the data above, removing the 9th grade has tremendously impacted the outcome for Thomas High Sschool and the passing percentages for both reading and math. It had little impact outside of THS numbers, but once we did make that change THS is now #2 by overall passing percentage.  There really is no significant change to scores by spending, size, or type of school. 


##Summary
1. Making the Nan change moved THS overall schools from the bottom ranking schools, to number 2 overall.  Telling us that the 9th graders at THS produced signifcantly worse results than the rest of the grades.

2. This could potentitally have an impact on school type as well, if we were to recieve real results for the 9th grade population at THS.  We could see a flip in the charter vs. district dataframe.

3. Another big change was in the average math and reading score by grade.  We noticed a Nan in the 9th grade for THS.  Data could change the outcome should we receive more conclusive data from THS.

4. Since changes were made mainly to THS 9th graders, school grades outside of this population stayed the same.
